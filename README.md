### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Colby Kledis and I am a student at ETSU. This is my 3rd year being a student here and I am enjoying working in the computer sciene program. 
My favorite hobbys are Dnd, playing video games and Magic the Gathering. 
Im interested learning more about Git and how to use it seemlessly without having to look up how to do things as often.
